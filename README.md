# Free Learning Roadmap: Python → Data Science → Machine Learning

This repository curates high-quality, free resources to learn Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning in a structured order. The goal is to move from programming fundamentals to applied ML skills suitable for intern / junior-level roles.

## Learning Path

1. Python fundamentals
2. Data Science (NumPy, pandas, visualization, data cleaning)
3. Machine Learning (scikit-learn, classical ML)
4. Optional specialization (via additional resources)
